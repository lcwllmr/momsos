## Code and figures

These are some additional resources for the talk.
You can find figures and references in here (after the talk).
The code for figures and numerical examples is hosted at [`gh:lcwllmr/momsos`](https://github.com/lcwllmr/momsos).

In particular, check out:
- [plot Motzkin polynomial](https://github.com/lcwllmr/momsos)
- [show that Motzkin is not SOS](https://github.com/lcwllmr/momsos)
- [find minimum of Motzkin polynomial](https://github.com/lcwllmr/momsos)
